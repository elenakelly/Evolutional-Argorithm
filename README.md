# Evolutional Argorithm

Here you can see a Evolutional Algorithm that is tested on benchmark functions

## Benchmark functions
Benchmark functions help us to understand if our algorithm works, thats why we used:
* Rosenbrock
* Rastrigin

## Installation
The program is in Python <br />
In order to use the code you need to install Numpy and Random for the calculations and Imageio and Matplotlib for the visualization
   ```sh
    import numpy as np
    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
    import imageio
    import random
   ```
